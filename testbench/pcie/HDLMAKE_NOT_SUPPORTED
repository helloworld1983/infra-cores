As of version 2.1, it's impossible to use HDLMake for simulation.
- HDLMake doesn't support VHDL libraries other than "work"
- it's impossible to pass defines/change compile options per file
- dependency resolution is still flaky
- user has no control over optimisation step. By directly invoking
	optimisation with proper parameters I was able cut down simulation time from 1 hour to < 6 minutes
	...and I'm still not finished
- few more things that I forgot right now

Therefore only traditionally scripted Questa simulation is now present. Works like a charm.
It shouldn't be difficult to rework these scripts for XSim support. Or directly invoke simulation from Vivado...
