# Infrastructure Cores

Gateware cores for providing infrastructure in building complex systems.

The cores available here could be categorized into the following:

## Bus Master Cores

Bus master cores comprising cores which bridges between a node
(CPU, another board, etc), to a SoC Bus (Wishbone, AXI, etc) such as:
Ethernet, PCIe, UART.

## Board/CI Interfaces Cores

Board/CI interfaces comprising cores to communicate to an external
chip/board (ADC mezzanine, Trigger mezzanine, etc)

## General Cores

General cores comprising cores used to group a common functionality,
such: reset synchronizers.
